# IOArbiter: QoS-aware Block Storage Management in the Cloud

<a href="https://github.com/att/ioarbiter">IOArbiter</a> aims
to provide QoS-aware block storage management in the cloud environment. 
The system intends to provide the following features:

* Dynamic backend configuration and binding: cloud tenants can create underlying storage
implementation at volume creation time, which significantly improve overall resource utilization.

* Per-tenant IOPS allocation: a tenant can expect minimum IOPS guarantee in pervolume
basis. 

* Improved space efficiency: inline deduplication/compression, thin-provisioning features will be collectively supported by other open source projects.
